# Font Finder and Blog

## Description

This project started as an idea to build a blog and rating/review site for fonts that developers can use to share their opinions and how they've used custom fonts from Google Fonts. It contains a small testing app where you can see a few different fonts in action as well as a blog where you can post reviews of fonts and comment on other peoples' posts.
